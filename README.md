# get-favicons

> A promise to return a list of favicons contained in some HTML content.

The streaming approach helps remaining efficient in spite of malformed or very large HTML documents.

**Notice**: this module requires `node>=4` to work.

# Install

```bash
$ npm install --save get-favicons
```

# Usage

## Node API

```js
const getFavicons = require('get-favicons');
const hyperquest = require('hyperquest');

const stream = hyperquest('http://www.bbc.com');

getFavicons(stream).then(icons => {
  // ...
});
```

You can also analyse a set of `<head>` tags provided as an array of objects
(eg: like these provided by [`parse-head`](https://npmjs.com/parse-head)):

```js
const getFavicons = require('get-favicons/from-array');

const headers = [ { nodeName: 'LINK', type: 'icon', href: '...'  }, ... ];

getFavicons(headers).then(icons => {
  // ...
});
```

## Command line

```bash
Usage: cat some/file.html | get-favicons [options]

  --all       Return all the found favicons â€” not only the biggest ones.
                                                                       [boolean]

              paths.
